Solving OOPs Problem


Problem Statements:Design a cache system with LRU eviction policy using OOP.


Solution Explanation:
Designing a cache system with an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy involves creating a data structure that can efficiently store and retrieve items while ensuring that the least recently used item is evicted when the cache reaches its capacity. In Java, we can achieve this using a combination of a HashMap (for fast lookups) and a Doubly Linked List (to maintain the order of usage).
